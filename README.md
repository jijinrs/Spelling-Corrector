Spelling Corrector Project

Overview
This project aims to develop a spelling corrector using Python. It involves building a system that can automatically correct misspelled words in a given text. The workflow includes loading the dataset, pre-processing the data, generating candidate words, defining the language model and channel model, and implementing the auto-correction functionality

Workflows
Loading the Dataset: Read the dataset containing text data for building the spelling corrector.
Pre-processing the Data: Clean and process the text data to extract words and their frequencies.
Generating Candidate Words: Generate candidate words by applying various operations such as insertion, deletion, substitution, and transposition.
Defining the Language Model: Define a language model to calculate the probability of a word occurring in the dataset.
Defining the Channel Model: Implement a channel model to handle known and unknown words and suggest corrections.
Auto Correction: Develop the auto-correction functionality to correct misspelled words in a given sentence.

Handling of context-specific errors.

Limited vocabulary coverage, especially for specialized domains.
Performance degradation with noisy or ambiguous inputs.
Additional Features
For further improvement, consider integrating additional features such as:

Context-aware correction using language models.
Integration of deep learning-based approaches for enhanced accuracy.
Development of a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.
